        <h2>What is Covid-19?</h2>
        <p>In early 2020, a new virus began generating headlines all over the world because of the unprecedented speed of its transmission.<br>
 COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered corona virus. Its origins have been traced to a food market in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. From there, it’s reached countries as distant as the United States and the Philippines.
 The virus (officially named SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible for millions of infections globally, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths.The disease caused by an infection with SARS-CoV-2 is called COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. </p>

                    <li>Everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they have to go out in public.</li>

        <center> <img src="harsh/corona.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" ></center>
    <br><ul>
      <li><h3 style="color:#228B22">Most people who get COVID-19 recover from it </h3>
Most people who get COVID-19 have mild or moderate symptoms and can recover thanks to supportive care. If you have a cough, fever and difficulty breathing seek medical care early - call your health facility by telephone first. If you have fever and live in an area with malaria or dengue seek medical care immediately.</li><br>
      <li> <h3 style="color:#228B22">Drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerous  </h3>
The harmful use of alcohol increases your risk of health problems.</li><br>
        <li> <h3 style="color:#228B22">Thermal scanners CANNOT detect COVID-19  </h3>
Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature). They cannot detect people who are infected with COVID-19. There are many causes of fever. Call your healthcare provider if you need assistance or seek immediate medical care if you have fever and live in an area with malaria or dengue.</li><br>
      <li> <h3 style="color:#228B22">There are currently no drugs licensed for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19  </h3>
While several drug trials are ongoing, there is currently no proof that hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent COVID-19. The misuse of hydroxychloroquine can cause serious side effects and illness and even lead to death. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop and evaluate medicines to treat COVID-19.</li><br>
      <li> <h3 style="color:#228B22">Spraying and introducing bleach or another disinfectant into your body WILL NOT protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerous  </h3>
Do not under any circumstance spray or introduce bleach or any other disinfectant into your body. These substances can be poisonous if ingested and cause irritation and damage to your skin and eyes.<br>
Bleach and disinfectant should be used carefully to disinfect surfaces only. Remember to keep chlorine (bleach) and other disinfectants out of reach of children.</li><br>
        <li> <h3 style="color:#228B22">5G mobile networks DO NOT spread COVID-19  </h3>
Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks.<br>
COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their eyes, mouth or nose. </li><br>
      <li><h3 style="color:#228B22">Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  </h3>
You can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19. To protect yourself, make sure you clean your hands frequently and thoroughly and avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.  </li><br>
      <li><h3 style="color:#228B22">You can recover from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Catching the new coronavirus DOES NOT mean you will have it for life.  </h3>
Most of the people who catch COVID-19 can recover and eliminate the virus from their bodies. If you catch the disease, make sure you treat your symptoms. If you have cough, fever, and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early – but call your health facility by telephone first. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.</li><br>
    <li><h3 style="color:#228B22">COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates  </h3>
The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by maintaining physical distance of at least 1 metre from others and frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.</li><br>
        <li><h3 style="color:#228B22">Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus.  </h3>
There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the external temperature or weather. The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water.</li><br>
      <li><h3 style="color:#228B22">Taking a hot bath does not prevent the new coronavirus disease  </h3>
        Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.</li><br>
        <li><h3 style="color:#228B22">Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?  </h3>
No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer.</li><br>
         <li><h3 style="color:#228B22">Ultra-violet (UV) lamps should not be used to disinfect hands or other areas of your skin  </h3>
UV radiation can cause skin irritation and damage your eyes.<br>
Cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing your hands with soap and water are the most effective ways to remove the virus.</li><br>
         <li><h3 style="color:#228B22">Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?  </h3>
To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.</li><br>
